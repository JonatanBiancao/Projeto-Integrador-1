# Car Website Project

## Overview
This project is a simple website dedicated to cars, featuring various pages that provide information, forms, and a table of technologies studied in the course. The website is structured to allow easy navigation between different sections.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- **index.html**: The homepage of the website, containing links to navigate to the form, about page, and table page.
- **about.html**: A page that defines and explains what FTP Server, JavaScript, and Docker are, providing a brief overview of each technology.
- **form.html**: A page that includes an HTML form with at least five different fields, images related to cars, and links to other pages.
- **table.html**: A page that features an HTML table with 2 columns and 5 rows, filled with names and descriptions of technologies/languages studied at the beginning of the course.
- **styles/style.css**: The CSS stylesheet that styles the HTML pages, linked to one or more of the HTML files to apply styles.
- **scripts/script.js**: A JavaScript file that enhances the functionality of the HTML pages, such as form validation or interactive elements.
